ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Retail businesses often struggle to understand how different product categories, regions, and customer segments contribute to overall sales and profit. Without real-time, interactive reporting, it becomes difficult for stakeholders to identify trends, underperforming segments, and seasonal spikes in demand.
This project addresses this gap by building an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to explore sales and profit data across multiple dimensions and generate actionable business insights.
